        <p>Many sanctuaries exist to keep animals protected from formerly neglected lives.  The animals come from a variety of places, zoos, circuses, and even just backyard pets.  Sanctuaries exist to give all animals who have been harmed a free and happy life. <br />
          <p>  </p>

  “We continue to get the calls every day: A family needs to find a home for their "pet" monkey that has become aggressive; endangered antelope bred for captive hunts will be killed by the highest bidder; chimpanzees from laboratories need placement, since they have failed as reliable test subjects for human disease; horses and donkeys are destined for slaughter; tigers living in a roadside zoo's deplorable conditions need immediate rescue and shelter. These stories are a mere glimpse of what is asked of just one sanctuary in a given week(“Why we Need Animal Sanctuaries OPED”).<br />
<p>  </p>
These animals are taken from horrible circumstances like the ones stated above, there's no other place for them besides the homes these genouse people have created.
